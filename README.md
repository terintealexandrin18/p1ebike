# E-Bike Specialist

E-Bike Specialist is a website that was created out of necessity. With the e-bike industry on the rise, there are few places that specialize in repairing them. Additionally, many shops that sell standard bikes are not equipped or willing to repair e-bikes. This website is aimed at e-bike users and food delivery drivers. Many riders are choosing e-bikes over motorcycles, and they need to know that we can fix any issues they may encounter.
